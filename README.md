# Sorting-Algorithms
Different sorting algorithms implementation in java

Algorithms included:
## Insertion Sort

## Bubble Sort
### Time Complexity:
- Best: O(n)
- Average: O(n²)
- Worst: O(n²)
### Key Points:
- Simple but inefficient for large datasets.
- Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
- Suitable for small datasets or nearly sorted data.

## Selection Sort
### Time Complexity:
- Best: O(n²)
- Average: O(n²)
- Worst: O(n²)
### Key Points:
- Selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion and swaps it with the first unsorted element.
- Inefficient for large datasets.
- Does not require extra space (in-place sorting)
