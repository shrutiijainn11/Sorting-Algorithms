# Sorting-Algorithms
Different sorting algorithms implementation in java

Algorithms included:
## Insertion Sort

## Bubble Sort
### Time Complexity:
- Best: O(n)
- Average: O(n²)
- Worst: O(n²)
### Key Points:
- Simple but inefficient for large datasets.
- Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
- Suitable for small datasets or nearly sorted data.
